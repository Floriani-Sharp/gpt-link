# Chrome extension to increase productivity based on ChatGPT (case of LinkedIn).

## GPT Link Extension

The GPT-Link extension is a powerful tool that increases your productivity when posting and commenting on unique and original content on LinkedIn. This extension is based on the advanced OpenAI GPT-3 technology and offers a wide range of features to help you create engaging and meaningful posts.

### Functions

#### Component 1: Term Explanation

This feature allows you to have selected terms explained on LinkedIn. Simply highlight the term you want, click the "Explain Term" button, and get the explanation. This allows you to better understand complex terms in your text and provide accurate information.

#### Component 2: Comment suggestion

The comment suggestion feature automatically generates comments for your LinkedIn posts. Simply select the filter you want (positive opinion, negative opinion, congratulations, question, share experience, contribute or suggest improvement) and instantly receive a matching comment suggestion. This makes it easier for you to write comments and saves valuable time.

#### Component 3: Rephrase comment

If you want to rephrase a comment, you can use this feature. Enter the existing comment and get a rephrased version. This is useful to make your comments on LinkedIn varied and interesting.

#### Component 4: View previous suggestions

This feature allows you to access previous comment suggestions and reworded comments. A simple click on the dropdown menu will show you a list of your previous suggestions. You can select the desired option and copy the comment directly to the clipboard to paste it into the comment field.
